1. Problem Statement

Many users, particularly those working in command-line environments, scripting, or educational settings, require a quick, straightforward tool for fundamental arithmetic calculations. Complex spreadsheet software or full-featured calculator applications often introduce unnecessary overhead. The problem is the need for a minimal, highly accessible, and reliable tool that focuses solely on the four basic mathematical operations.

2. Scope of the Project

The project is focused on developing a lightweight, console-based application that can perform the four core arithmetic functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.


3. Target Users

The primary target users are individuals who value speed and simplicity in performing calculations, including:

Students/Educators: Needing to quickly verify arithmetic problems or demonstrate basic programming concepts.

Developers/Engineers: Requiring fast, in-terminal calculations while scripting or debugging.

Command-Line Enthusiasts: Users who prefer to perform tasks without leaving the console environment.

4. High-Level Features

The application will provide the following essential capabilities:

Operation Menu: Display a simple, numbered menu allowing the user to select one of the four available operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide).

Number Input: Prompt the user to enter the first and second number required for the calculation.

Core Calculation Logic: Accurate execution of the selected arithmetic function.
